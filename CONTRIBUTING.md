## Setup instructions

[This Firefox guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension) on how to make your first web extension is a good starting point to learn about the WebExtensions API. The first guide covers the basic directory structure, and how to debug the extension by sideloading it into the browser. Links to related documentation can be found on the Sidebar to the left.

We recommend using Firefox Developer Edition while developing the extension. We don't mind if you also test it on versions below Firefox 56, but our main aim is to support version 57+

Most `console.log` messages have been commented out rather than removed. So you can simply uncomment them to get suitable console output that will let you track the content of the variables as well as the flow of the program.
